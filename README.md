# Roblox-Industrialist-Recipes
This repository contains a JSON file of (hopefully) every recipe in the Roblox game Industrialist.

It took me about five hours of manually typing in each recipe, so I would be very thankful if you credit me for using this file.
Please let me know if there are any typoes or mispellings in the files.

P.S.: 1.) Advanced Oil Seperator is not a typo, that is the actual name for some reason.
      2.) If an item didn't have a listed source in the recipe book, I wrote the building it came from (ex. Exhaust coming from Coal Power Plant with Distilled Water and Coal).
      3.) Power cost and other information about recipes are not listed; if you need that information, I could make another file containing the information or add onto the existing file.

Credit to sparkles3421 for polishing my file in PRETTYRECIPES.json and PRETTYRECIPESEXPANDED.json
